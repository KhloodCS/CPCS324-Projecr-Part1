/*MSTAlgorithm: is a superclass representing the general characteristics of an algorithm for computing
the minimum spanning tree. It has three subclasses: KruskalAlg and MHPrimAlg. It contains the
following attributes and functions:
Attributes displayed via association relationship in the diagram: MSTResultList attribute is a list of
objects of the type Edge. It stores the parent of the vertex and the weight needed by the MST algorithm.
displayResultingMST(): it is an abstract function that should be implemented by the subclassesâ€™
polymorphic functions. */
